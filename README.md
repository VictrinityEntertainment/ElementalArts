# ElementalArts

This game is meant to bring you the dreams of being able to control certain elements to life.

This game has no association with ATLA or Nickaloadian at all just two dudes inspired by what the creators of ATLA made

The game is in the early stages of development, so do not expect much

This is being made by only two people so be patient, we have a LOT to doâ€¦ we have lives outside of making games

Try not to ask the same questions as other people, look here then check the chat for the previous week or so, then ask your question

About The Game

This game will be a VR RPG, with elements like the ones seen in the demo

We plan to make sub-elements and/or mastery moves that you can learn in game by finding temples, ruins, etc...

This game will be open world

This game will be low-poly, because the quest can't handle better

It will be the same experience for Quest, Rift/S, and SteamVR users, just the Quest will have less particles and such

we have incorporated all four elements.

Again this game is being made by TWO PEOPLE so do not expect AAA quality. We are just indie Devs, we are here for fun. I don't think I can stress this point enough
